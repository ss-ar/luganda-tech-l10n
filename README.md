# Luganda Tech Localization (l10n)

Community-driven standards for Luganda localization in open-source software.

---

## 🌍 About This Project

This project aims to develop clear, consistent, and modern Luganda terminology for use in open-source software projects such as Linux distributions, desktop environments, and other free software systems.

Our goal is to make technology more accessible to Luganda speakers by ensuring translations are:

* Clear and understandable
* Grammatically correct
* Technically accurate
* Consistent across projects

> **Ekigendererwa kyaffe kwe kutumbula olulimi oluganda mu by’okukozesa tekinologiya n’okukola ku pulogulaamu ez’enjawulo mu ngeri entegeerekeka era ennyonnyofu.**

## 🔤 What is l10n?

**l10n** stands for *localization*.

Localization means adapting software to a specific language and cultural context. In this case, we focus on **Luganda (ISO 639-1: lg, ISO 639-2/3: lug)**.

Localization includes:

* Translating user interfaces
* Standardizing technical terminology
* Defining style and grammar guidelines
* Ensuring consistency across platforms

---

## 🎯 Scope

This project is not limited to one software platform.

It is intended to support Luganda translations across:

* Linux distributions
* Desktop environments
* Open-source applications
* Educational software
* Community technology initiatives

> **Tetukoma ku pulogulaamu emu yokka. Tugenderera okukola ku mirimu gyonna egy’ensibuko ey’olukale (open-source).**

## 🤝 Community-Based Approach

This project is community-driven.

Although it was initiated by an individual contributor, it is intended to grow into a collaborative effort involving translators, linguists, developers, and open-source contributors.

> **Omulimu guno gwa bantu bonna. Tuli wamu okutumbula olulimi oluganda mu nsi yebya tekinologiya.**

Contributions are welcome from:

* Native Luganda speakers
* Linguistics students
* Open-source contributors
* Software translators
