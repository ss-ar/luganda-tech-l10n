# Governance Model

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how decisions are made, how leadership is structured, and how contributors collaborate within the Luganda Tech Localization project.

The goal is to ensure transparency, consistency, and long-term sustainability as a community-driven initiative.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

The project operates under the following principles:

* **Community-first** – The project exists for the benefit of the wider Luganda-speaking and open-source community.
* **Transparency** – All major decisions are documented publicly.
* **Consistency** – Terminology and style decisions follow agreed standards.
* **Openness** – Contributions are welcome from all qualified and respectful participants.
* **Sustainability** – The project should not depend on a single individual.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

### 3.1 Initial Coordinator

The project was initiated by an individual contributor who currently serves as the Initial Coordinator.

Responsibilities:

* Reviewing and approving terminology changes
* Ensuring consistency with the style guide
* Maintaining documentation
* Facilitating discussions
* Representing the project in external localization communities (e.g., GNOME, Fedora, KDE)

The Initial Coordinator role is not permanent and may evolve as the community grows.

---

### 3.2 Contributors

Contributors may:

* Propose new terminology
* Suggest improvements to the style guide
* Open issues for discussion
* Submit pull requests
* Participate in terminology debates

All contributors are expected to follow respectful communication practices.

---

### 3.3 Reviewers (Future Role)

As the project grows, trusted contributors may be designated as Reviewers.

Responsibilities:

* Reviewing glossary additions
* Verifying consistency with existing standards
* Assisting in resolving terminology disputes

Reviewers are appointed through community consensus.

---

## 4. Decision-Making Process

### 4.1 Minor Changes

Minor edits (spelling corrections, formatting, small clarifications) may be approved directly by a Coordinator or Reviewer.

---

### 4.2 Terminology Decisions

For new or disputed technical terms:

1. An issue must be opened.
2. Context must be provided (where the term appears).
3. Suggested translation(s) must be included.
4. Discussion remains open for community input.
5. A final decision is documented in:

   * `docs/GLOSSARY.md`
   * `docs/DECISIONS/` (if significant)

Consensus is preferred. If consensus cannot be reached, the Coordinator may make a final decision, which must be documented.

---

## 5. Conflict Resolution

If disagreement arises:

1. Participants are encouraged to provide linguistic or technical justification.
2. Discussions should remain focused on clarity, usability, and consistency.
3. If necessary, a temporary decision may be made and revisited later.
4. All final outcomes must be documented for transparency.

Personal attacks, hostility, or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.

---

## 6. Leadership Evolution

As the project matures:

* Additional coordinators may be added.
* Roles may be formalized through voting or consensus.
* Governance structure may be revised through documented proposals.

Any major governance change must:

* Be proposed via issue
* Be discussed openly
* Be approved by consensus or majority agreement

---

## 7. Project Neutrality

This project is platform-neutral.

It is not owned by or limited to any specific software ecosystem (e.g., GNOME, Fedora, KDE, Debian).

The objective is to maintain consistent Luganda terminology across open-source technologies.

---

## 8. Amendments

This governance document may be amended as the community grows.

All amendments must:

1. Be proposed publicly.
2. Be discussed openly.
3. Be documented clearly in commit history.

---

**This governance model ensures that the Luganda Tech Localization project remains structured, inclusive, and sustainable.**
